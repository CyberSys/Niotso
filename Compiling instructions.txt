cd into the _build directory and run
 $ cmake -G "<Generator name>" ..

The list of generators can be found with cmake --help.

//-- Makefile

Run "make" to compile every package. -j # will greatly speed up the compile time for processors with # cores.
Run "make install" after compiling to install Niotso to your game directory; please specify it first in the Makefile.

Run "make objclean" to delete all object files created during compilation.
Run "make clean" to delete all object files and executable files created during compilation.
Run "make distclean" to delete all files of any kind created during compilation. (Includes profile-collection files.)
