Because there are too many long-term things to list that we still have "to do" to reach the next development phase (e.g.
alpha to beta), this file contains only the things that are worked on currently or that will be in the very near future.

While anybody is free to work on _anything_ at any point during Niotso's time, this list shall ONLY contain those relevant
to complete the criteria for the next development phase, which can be found here:
<http://wiki.niotso.org/Niotso_Release_Schedule>

//----------//

Tasks will be added for the server when the development phase reaches Alpha.
