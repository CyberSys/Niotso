## Copying

Niotso Client and Niotso Server are distributed under the terms of the GNU GPLv3.

While this license does permit others to compile, distribute, change, and distribute changes to Niotso, in reality, many of these freedoms cannot legally be enacted by anybody.

Specifically, if you make changes to Niotso such that it significantly changes the "game experience as presented to the player", it cannot be distributed to others. You also may not distribute a version of Niotso that has stripped the EA or Maxis trademarked names or logos anywhere from the game. Personal use of these modifications is okay.

These restrictions are not enforced by us, but may potentially be used by EA in attempt to take down your game.
